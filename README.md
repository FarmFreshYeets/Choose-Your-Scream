# Choose-Your-Scream

## User Story
 As a fan of movies and food, I want to be able to go to a fun and functioning website where I can search for a movie, and also find a snack that goes with the flick I'm about to watch.

 WHEN I open the website, 
 
 THEN you'll be prompted to enter the movie you wish to search

 THEN choose your rating for your age range

 THEN add any actors/actresses you wish to specifiy in your search

WHEN you click "SUBMIT"

THEN an eventListener takes affect and the results page will appear

WHEN the movie results appear, a list of recommended snacks/beverges will appear
