# Steamin' and Streamin'

## Description
As a fan of movies and food, I want to be able to go to a fun and functioning 

website where I can get movie recommendations by searching a keyword, and then 

a random selection of movies appear referring to that keyword.  Underneath the movie 
 
results is another search area where you can then put in another keyword, and a random 
 
recipe will appear at the bottom of the page that you can make and enjoy while 
 
watching your movie.

## Technologies
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Bulma
* jQuery
* IMBD
* Edemam
* Google Font

## Usage
WHEN I open the website, 
 
THEN you'll be prompted to enter your age rating

THEN add a keyword to bring up the movie recommendations

WHEN you click "enter/return"

THEN an eventListener takes affect and the results page will appear

WHEN the results page appears, a list of 3 recommended movies pop up, and 

underneath the recommendations, the random recipe will appear, with a recipe on 

how to make it.

THEN you choose which flick to watch, 

and enjoy your steamin' "meal" while you're streamin' your film!
