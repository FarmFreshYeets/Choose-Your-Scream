# Steamin' and Streamin'

## Description
The goal of this project was to collaborate with a team to create an application that allows a user to find randomly generated movies based on a keyword input and find a food recipe based on another keyword input. This was accomplished with the use of APIs from IMDB for movie information and Edamam for food recipes. While developing this application, our team was able to strengthen our communication and task delegation skills.

If a keyword and and age rating pair have search results, you will see 3 randomly chosen movies and their plot descriptions. If you scroll down in the results page, you will see a space to input another keyword for a food recipe.
