# Steamin' and Streamin'

## User Story
 As a fan of movies and food, I want to be able to go to a fun and functioning website where I can get movie recommendations by searching a keyword, and then a random selection of movies appear referring to that keyword.  Then a random recipe appears at the bottom of the page that one can make and enjoy while watching their movie.

 WHEN I open the website, 
 
 THEN you'll be prompted to enter your age rating

 THEN add a keyword to bring up the movie recommendations

WHEN you click "enter/return"

THEN an eventListener takes affect and the results page will appear

WHEN the results page appears, a list of 3 recommended movies pop up, and underneath the recommendations, the random recipe will appear, with a recipe on how to make it.

THEN you choose which flick to watch, 
and enjoy your steamin' "meal" while you're streamin' your film!
